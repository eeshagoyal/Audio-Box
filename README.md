# PrimaSeller-JS-test

Problem Statement :-
	We will build a small and simple artist search APP using the audiodb APIs (http://www.theaudiodb.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=7). You can use the test API KEY “1” for testing.
	The app has three screen:
	1) The first screen is a search page where you can search for an artist by name.
	There could be multiple artists that match the name, so make sure that you handle pagination where the user can see the results page by page.
	2) Once you have found the artist you were searching for, click on the “View Albums” link will take you to an artist detail page where you will list (again, paginated) the albums of the artist.
	3) Clicking on the View Tracks of an album listing will open up a modal that shows the album name, the release date and a list of tracks in the album and the durationof each track.

Evaluation Criteria :-
	Your submission will be evaluated on your code – structure, organization and modularity, how closely it meets the requirements we have described above, error handling, visual layout. We encourage you to try and make the APP responsive so that it displays well on a mobile browser.
